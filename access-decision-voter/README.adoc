= Custom Access Decision Voter

You might have a need for a custom access decision voter when security decisions are made based on who is accessing what domain object.
Luckily Spring Security has quite a few options to implement such access control list (ACL) constraints.

== Implementation
We'll explore a system where users share spreadsheets, with access per spreadsheet stored separately.
We've explicitly modeled the permission storage as simple as can be; imagine it's calling out to a system of record elsewhere.
Note that in this simplified implementation, access decisions are binary: you either have access or you don't.
There's no distinction between READ/WRITE access in this implementation.

=== Secured annotation
Opening `SpreadsheetService` reveals a single method annotated with `@Secured`.

[source,java]
----
@Secured("com.jdriven.model.Spreadsheet")
public void read(Spreadsheet spreadsheet) {
  log.info("Reading {}", spreadsheet);
}
----

The `@Secured` annotation argument is the fully qualified class name of the domain object access we are aiming to restrict.
The method has an argument of the same type, which is the specific instance we'll secure.

Conveniently the `@Secured` annotation need not reference the argument by name; it can be retrieved by type alone in our `AccessDecisionVoter`.

=== AccessDecisionVoter
Access decisions are made by an `AccessDecisionManager`, which delegates out to a list of configured `AccessDecisionVoters`.
Voters can choose to *GRANT* or *DENY* a particular method invocation, based on their application logic.
If a voter can not decide on a particular method invocation, it can choose to *ABSTAIN* to leave the decision up to further voters.
By default you'll get the `AffirmativeBased` access decision manager, which allows a method invocation _if just one of the voters_ votes to *GRANT* access, regardless of any votes to *DENY* access.

Four our purposes we want a custom voter that validates user access to a spreadsheet against the stored access records.
We do so by extending `AbstractAclVoter`, which for a configured processed domain object class and method invocation can look up the argument domain object instance.
We'll implement the `vote` method, which is passed the authenticated user, the secured `MethodInvocation` and a collection of `ConfigAttributes`.
[source,java]
----
@Override
public int vote(Authentication authentication, MethodInvocation methodInvocation, Collection<ConfigAttribute> attributes) {
  for (ConfigAttribute configAttribute : attributes) {
    if (supports(configAttribute)) {
      User principal = (User) authentication.getPrincipal();
      Spreadsheet domainObjectInstance = (Spreadsheet) getDomainObjectInstance(methodInvocation);
      return hasSpreadsheetAccess(principal, domainObjectInstance) ? ACCESS_GRANTED : ACCESS_DENIED;
    }
  }
  return ACCESS_ABSTAIN;
}
----
Our voter is passed one or more `ConfigAttributes`, as passed to the `@Secured` annotation itself, which we validate by calling `boolean supports(ConfigAttribute)`:
[source,java]
----
@Override
public boolean supports(ConfigAttribute attribute) {
  return getProcessDomainObjectClass().getName().equals(attribute.getAttribute());
}
----
Given these implementations, the voter will *ABSTAIN* only when the `ConfigAttribute` does not match the configured `ProcessDomainObjectClass`.
In all other cases the voter will vote to *GRANT* or *DENY* access, according to the access records stored.

=== Configuration
We need to configure two parts of our application for our custom access decision voter logic to trigger.

Firstly, we need to activate the `@Secured` annotations through `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(securedEnabled = true)`, which is done in `AccessDecisionConfiguration`.

Secondly, we need to add our `SpreadsheetAccessDecisionVoter` to the list of decision voters considered by the `AccessDecisionManager`.
For this we extend `GlobalMethodSecurityConfiguration` to override `AccessDecisionManager accessDecisionManager()`.
We call `super.accessDecisionManager()` to get the default `AffirmativeBased` access decision manager, and merely add our own voter at the end.

Should you have a need to secure more than one domain object type, it's easy enough to add more voters to the list.

=== Tests
Our `SpreadsheetAccessDecisionVoterIT` tests use mock users _Alice_ and _Bob_, with a malicious third user _Eve_, all trying to access a single spreadsheet.

You can see access to the spreadsheet abides by the rules stored at the start of each test:

- _Alice_ is able to access the spreadsheet.
- _Bob_ is also able to access the spreadsheet.
- _Eve_ is unable to access the spreadsheet, as she gets an `AccessDeniedException`.


== Alternatives
For highly customizable access storage you might adopt 
https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.7.1/servlet/authorization/acls.html[Spring Securityâ€™s ACL services], as shipped in `spring-security-acl-xxx.jar`.
This provides a very powerful method of encoding, storing and retrieving access permissions.
