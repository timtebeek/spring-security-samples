= Custom Permission Evaluator

Often you'll find access decisions move beyond simplistic ownership or having a certain role, for instance when users share domain objects with other users.
In such cases it's common to separate permission to view an instance from being able to make changes to the same instance.
When your access rules are relatively straightforward, Spring Security offers the `PermissionEvaluator` interface to secure instance access.

== Implementation
We'll explore a system where users share spreadsheets, with permissions to view/edit stored separately.
We've explicitly modeled the permission storage as simple as can be; imagine it's calling out to a system of record elsewhere.

=== Security expressions
Opening `SpreadsheetService` reveals four methods with different arguments, each annotated with `@PreAuthorize`.
The expressions passed into `@PreAuthorize` refer to method arguments by name, and use the built in `hasPermission(...)`.

[source,java]
----
@PreAuthorize("hasPermission(#spreadsheet, 'READ')")
public void read(Spreadsheet spreadsheet) {
  log.info("Reading {}", spreadsheet);
}

@PreAuthorize("hasPermission(#id, 'com.jdriven.model.Spreadsheet', 'READ')")
public void readById(Long id) {
  log.info("Reading Spreadsheet id {} ", id);
}
----

The https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.6.4/servlet/authorization/expression-based.html#el-common-built-in[`hasPermission` methods return `true` if the user has access to the provided target for the given permission].

==== Meta annotations
To help keep your code readable, and prevent duplication you can
https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.6.4/servlet/authorization/expression-based.html#_method_security_meta_annotations[create your own meta-annotations].
These allow you to write your security expression once, and use your own annotations throughout your code base.

=== PermissionEvaluator
The default `SecurityExpressionHandler` delegates `hasPermission` invocations to a unique  `PermissionEvaluator` bean, if configured.
If no `PermissionEvaluator` bean is provided, it will fallback to the `DenyAllPermissionEvaluator` to prevent method invocations.

So, in order to make our own access decisions we have to implement the `PermissionEvaluator` interface and provide a bean instance.
The interface has the following methods:
[source,java]
----
public interface PermissionEvaluator extends AopInfrastructureBean {

  boolean hasPermission(Authentication authentication, Object targetDomainObject, Object permission);

  boolean hasPermission(Authentication authentication, Serializable targetId, String targetType, Object permission);

}
----
From the interface method arguments it should be clear how these map to security expression arguments.

NOTE: You can only provide a single `PermissionEvaluator` bean, so if you want to support several target types, you'll have to handle that within a single instance.

We've provided an `CustomPermissionEvaluator` implementation to serve as an example.
It first checks the target domain object type, before calling out to the appropriate permission store to check for access.
The access rules here are modeled quite simply, but you can extend this as much as needed for your domain.

Lastly, the `@PreAuthorize` annotations need to be activated through `@EnableGlobalMethodSecurity(prePostEnabled = true)`, which is done in `PermissionEvaluatorConfiguration`.

=== Tests
Our `CustomPermissionEvaluatorIT` tests use mock users _Alice_ and _Bob_, with a malicious third user _Eve_, all trying to read and write a single spreadsheet.

You can see access to the spreadsheet abides by the access permissions stored at the start of each test:

- _Alice_ is able to both *READ* and *WRITE* the spreadsheet.
- _Bob_ is able to *READ* the spreadsheet, but get's an `AccessDeniedException` when he tried to *WRITE*.
- _Eve_ always gets an `AccessDeniedException`.


== Alternatives
You can achieve much of the same functionality, by extending `AbstractAclVoter`, discussed separately.
For highly customizable access rules you might even adopt
https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.6.4/servlet/authorization/acls.html[Spring Securityâ€™s ACL services], as shipped in `spring-security-acl-xxx.jar`.
This provides a very powerful method of encoding, storing and retrieving access permissions.
