= Using WireMock to serve `issuer-uri`

Our tests need to connect to a OpenID Connect provider to bootstrap the application context.

== Recording with WireMock
We've previously ran WireMock in proxy mode to record the calls made to our Keycloak OpenID Connect provider:
----
java -jar wiremock-standalone-2.25.1.jar --record-mappings --proxy-all="http://localhost:8090"
----

The resulting `mappings` and `__files` can be found in this folder.

== Running WireMock
To serve the recorded mappings with WireMock we can run the same jar:
----
java -jar wiremock-standalone-2.25.1.jar --port 8090
----

== Verifying endpoint
To verify the required endpoint is available, open up:
http://localhost:8090/auth/realms/spring-cloud-gateway-realm/.well-known/openid-configuration
