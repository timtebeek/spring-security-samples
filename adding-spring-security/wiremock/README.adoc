= Using WireMock to serve `issuer-uri`

Our tests need to connect to a OpenID Connect provider to bootstrap the application context.

== Download WireMock

1. https://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock-jre8-standalone/2.33.2/wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.33.2.jar[Download WireMock]
2. Move `wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.33.2.jar` into `spring-security-samples/adding-spring-security/wiremock`.

== Recording with WireMock
We've previously ran WireMock in proxy mode to record the calls made to our Keycloak OpenID Connect provider:
----
java -jar wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.33.2.jar --record-mappings --proxy-all="http://localhost:8090"
----

The resulting `mappings` and `__files` can be found in this folder.

== Running WireMock
To serve the recorded mappings with WireMock:

1. Navigate to: `adding-spring-security/wiremock/`
2. https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/com/github/tomakehurst/wiremock-jre8-standalone/2.33.2/wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.33.2.jar[Download WireMock standalone]
3. Run `java -jar wiremock-jre8-standalone-2.33.2.jar --port 8090`
4. Verify you get a JSON response from:
http://localhost:8090/auth/realms/spring-cloud-gateway-realm/.well-known/openid-configuration
