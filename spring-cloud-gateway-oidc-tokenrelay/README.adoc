= Spring Cloud Gateway with OpenID Connect and Token Relay

> Spring Cloud Gateway aims to provide a simple, yet effective way to route to APIs and provide cross cutting concerns to them such as: security, monitoring/metrics, and resiliency.

When combined with Spring Security 5.2+ and an OpenID Provider such as Keycloak, one can rapidly setup a secure gateway for OAuth2 resource servers.

Where link:../gateway/README.adoc[our WebFlux-based Gateway post] explores the various choices and considerations when implementing a gateway, this post assumes those choices have already resulted in the above.
We consider this combination a promising standards-based gateway solution, with desirable characteristics such as hiding tokens from the client, while keeping complexity to a minimum.

== Implementation

Our sample models a travel website, implemented as a gateway, with two resource servers for flights and hotels.
We're using https://www.thymeleaf.org[Thymeleaf] as a template engine to keep the technology stack limited to and based on Java.
Each component renders part of the overall website, to model domain separation in an exploration of https://martinfowler.com/articles/micro-frontends.html[Micro Frontends].

=== Keycloak

Once again we've chosen to use https://www.keycloak.org[Keycloak] as our identity provider; although any OpenID Provider ought to work.
Configuration consists of link:keycloak/README.adoc[creating a realm, client and user], and configuring the gateway with those details.

=== Gateway

Our Gateway is rather minimal in terms of dependencies, code and configuration.

==== Dependencies
1. Authentication with the OpenID Provider is handled through `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-oauth2-client`
2. Gateway functionality is offered through `org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-starter-gateway`
3. Relaying the token to the proxied resource servers comes from `org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-security`

==== Code
Aside from the common `@SpringBootApplication` annotation and a few web controller endpoints, all we need is:
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public SecurityWebFilterChain springSecurityFilterChain(ServerHttpSecurity http,
    ReactiveClientRegistrationRepository clientRegistrationRepository) {
  // Authenticate through configured OpenID Provider
  http.oauth2Login();
  // Also logout at the OpenID Connect provider
  http.logout(logout -> logout.logoutSuccessHandler(new OidcClientInitiatedServerLogoutSuccessHandler(clientRegistrationRepository)));
  // Require authentication for all requests
  http.authorizeExchange().anyExchange().authenticated();
  // Allow showing /home within a frame
  http.headers().frameOptions().mode(Mode.SAMEORIGIN);
  // Disable CSRF in the gateway to prevent conflicts with proxied service CSRF
  http.csrf().disable();
  return http.build();
}
----
==== Configuration
Configuration is split in two parts; one part for the OpenID Provider.
The `issuer-uri` property refers to the https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8414#section-3[RFC 8414 Authorization Server Metadata] endpoint exposed bij Keycloak.
If you append `.well-known/openid-configuration` to the URL you'll see the details used to configure authentication through OpenID.
Notice how we also set the `user-name-attribute` to instruct our client to use the specified claim as our user name.
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      client:
        provider:
          keycloak:
            issuer-uri: http://localhost:8090/auth/realms/spring-cloud-gateway-realm
            user-name-attribute: preferred_username
        registration:
          keycloak:
            client-id: spring-cloud-gateway-client
            client-secret: 016c6e1c-9cbe-4ad3-aee1-01ddbb370f32
----
The second part of our Gateway configuration consists of the routes and services to proxy, and instructions to relay our tokens.
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  cloud:
    gateway:
      default-filters:
      - TokenRelay
      routes:
      - id: flights-service
        uri: http://127.0.0.1:8081/flights
        predicates:
        - Path=/flights/**
      - id: hotels-service
        uri: http://127.0.0.1:8082/hotels
        predicates:
        - Path=/hotels/**
----
`TokenRelay` activates the `TokenRelayGatewayFilterFactory`, which appends the user `Bearer` to downstream proxied requests.
We specifically match path prefixes to our services, which align with the `server.servlet.context-path` used within those services.

==== Testing
The OpenID connect client configuration requires the configured provider URL to be available when the application starts.
To get around this in our tests we've link:/spring-cloud-gateway-oidc-tokenrelay/travel-spring-cloud-gateway/src/test/resources/README.adoc[recorded the Keycloak response with WireMock], and replay that when our tests run.
Once the test application context is started, we want to make an authenticated request to our gateway.
For this, we use the new https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.6.3/reactive/test/web/oauth2.html#webflux-testing-oidc-login[`SecurityMockServerConfigurers#mockOidcLogin()`] Mutator introduced in Spring Security 5.0.
Using this we can set any properties we might need; to mimic what our gateway normally handles for us.

=== Resource servers
Our resource servers only differ in name; one for flights, and another for hotels.
Each contains a minimal web application showing the user name, to highlight that it's passed along to the server.

==== Dependencies
We add `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server` to our resource server projects, which transitively supplies three dependencies.

1. Token validation as per the configured OpenID Provider is handled through `org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-resource-server`
2. JSON Web Tokens are decoded using `org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-jose`
3. Customization of token handling requires `org.springframework.security:spring-security-config`

==== Code
Our resource servers need a bit more code to customize various aspects of the token handling.

Firstly, we need to the basics of security; ensuring tokens are decoded and checked properly, and required on each request.
[source,java]
----
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig extends WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter {

  @Override
  protected void configure(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    // Validate tokens through configured OpenID Provider
    http.oauth2ResourceServer().jwt().jwtAuthenticationConverter(jwtAuthenticationConverter());
    // Require authentication for all requests
    http.authorizeRequests().anyRequest().authenticated();
    // Allow showing pages within a frame
    http.headers().frameOptions().sameOrigin();
  }

  ...
}
----

Secondly, we choose to extract authorities from the the claims within our Keycloak tokens.
This step is optional, and will differ based on your configured OpenID Provider and role mappers.
[source,java]
----
private JwtAuthenticationConverter jwtAuthenticationConverter() {
  JwtAuthenticationConverter converter = new JwtAuthenticationConverter();
  // Convert realm_access.roles claims to granted authorities, for use in access decisions
  converter.setJwtGrantedAuthoritiesConverter(new KeycloakRealmRoleConverter());
  return converter;
}

[...]

class KeycloakRealmRoleConverter implements Converter<Jwt, Collection<GrantedAuthority>> {
  @Override
  public Collection<GrantedAuthority> convert(Jwt jwt) {
    final Map<String, Object> realmAccess = (Map<String, Object>) jwt.getClaims().get("realm_access");
    return ((List<String>) realmAccess.get("roles")).stream()
      .map(roleName -> "ROLE_" + roleName)
      .map(SimpleGrantedAuthority::new)
      .collect(Collectors.toList());
  }
}
----

Thirdly we again https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.6.3/servlet/oauth2/resource-server/jwt.html#oauth2resourceserver-jwt-claimsetmapping[extract the `preferred_name` as authentication name], to match up with our gateway.
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public JwtDecoder jwtDecoderByIssuerUri(OAuth2ResourceServerProperties properties) {
  String issuerUri = properties.getJwt().getIssuerUri();
  NimbusJwtDecoder jwtDecoder = (NimbusJwtDecoder) JwtDecoders.fromIssuerLocation(issuerUri);
  // Use preferred_username from claims as authentication name, instead of UUID subject
  jwtDecoder.setClaimSetConverter(new UsernameSubClaimAdapter());
  return jwtDecoder;
}

[...]

class UsernameSubClaimAdapter implements Converter<Map<String, Object>, Map<String, Object>> {

  private final MappedJwtClaimSetConverter delegate = MappedJwtClaimSetConverter.withDefaults(Collections.emptyMap());

  @Override
  public Map<String, Object> convert(Map<String, Object> claims) {
    Map<String, Object> convertedClaims = this.delegate.convert(claims);
    String username = (String) convertedClaims.get("preferred_username");
    convertedClaims.put("sub", username);
    return convertedClaims;
  }

}
----

==== Configuration
In terms of configuration we again have two separate concerns.

Firstly we aim to start the service on a different port and context-path, to line up with the gateway proxy configuration.
[source,yaml]
----
server:
  port: 8082
  servlet:
    context-path: /hotels/
----

Secondly, we configure the resource server with the same `issuer-uri` as we did in the gateway, to ensure tokens are decoded and validated properly.
[source,yaml]
----
spring:
  security:
    oauth2:
      resourceserver:
        jwt:
          issuer-uri: http://localhost:8090/auth/realms/spring-cloud-gateway-realm
----

==== Testing
The Hotels and Flights service both https://docs.spring.io/spring-security/reference/5.6.3/servlet/test/mockmvc/oauth2.html#testing-jwt[swap out the `JwtDecoder` bean for a mock].
They use the new `jwt() RequestPostProcessor` introduced in Spring Security 5.2 to easily change JWT characteristics.

== Conclusion
With all this in place we have the basics of a functioning gateway.
It redirects users to Keycloak for authentication, while hiding the JSON Web Token from the user.
Any proxied requests to resource servers are enriched with the appropriate user `access_token`, which is verified and converted into an `JwtAuthenticationToken` for use in access decisions.

== Further work
While this post outlines the basics for a functioning gateway, further work might be needed in terms of session duration, persistence and https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-security/issues/175[token refresh flows].
We expect these concerns to become easier to manage as development on Spring Cloud Gateway and Security continues.

== Upgrading from `spring-security-oauth`
If you've previously used `spring-security-oauth` you might now be wondering:

> What ever happened to `@EnableResourceServer`, `@EnableOAuth2Client`, `@EnableOAuth2Sso` and `ResourceServerConfigurer`?

The https://spring.io/blog/2019/11/14/spring-security-oauth-2-0-roadmap-update[Spring Security OAuth] project containing these classes has been put into maintenance mode, with OAuth2 resource server and client support now https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/wiki/OAuth-2.0-Features-Matrix[moved into Spring Security 5.2+].
Going forward we suggest you:

- remove any dependency on:
 * `org.springframework.security.oauth:spring-security-oauth`
 * `org.springframework.security.oauth.boot:spring-security-oauth2-autoconfigure`
- replace these with `org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-oauth2-resource-server`, as outlined above.
